Here is the brief introduction to all the 5 mentionable projects that I have completed during my internship in Unified Mentor Private Limited as a Dat Analyst Intern.<br>
Project 1: Atliq Hospitality Analysis<br>
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and is in the industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the
luxury/business hotels category. The dashboard prepared in PowerBI shows a brief information display about the analysis of Atliq's hospitality. <br>
Project 2: Bird Strikes Analysis<br>
Bird Strikes are a significant threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engine ones, are vulnerable to the loss
of thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in several fatal accidents. The analysis report finds the reasons and impacts of the accident
that took place in the US from 2000-2011.A overall dashboard is also presented for ease of visualization.
